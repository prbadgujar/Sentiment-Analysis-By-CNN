<h1>🧠 Sentiment Analysis using CNN</h1>

<h3>📌 Overview</h3>
This project implements Sentiment Analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify twitter text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The model leverages word embeddings and deep learning techniques to understand the context of words in a sentence.

<h3>🛠 Tech Stack</h3>  

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)  
TensorFlow  (CNN Model)  
NLTK (Text Preprocessing)  
Word2Vec (Word Embeddings)  

<h3>🔍 Features</h3>

✔ Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization  
✔ Embedding Layer: Converts text into meaningful numerical representations  
✔ CNN Architecture: Extracts local patterns in text  
✔ Sentiment Classification: Positive, Negative, Neutral  

<h3>📊 Results</h3>  

Training Accuracy: 90%  
Test Accuracy: 85%  

<h3>📝 Future Enhancements</h3>

🔹 Fine-tune embeddings using transformer models  
🔹 Expand dataset for improved generalization
